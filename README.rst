Mal-Py: a minimal assembler and runtime environment
###################################################

"Mal-py" is a minimal assembler and run-time environment to teach assembly.
It focuses on the principles of Assembly using a Von Neumann Architecture.

A special thanks to `pyca/cryptography`_ for their ideas on travis integration
with pyenv, tox, and osx. Much of the meta build system and testing scaffolding
is based significantly off of theirs.

Mal-Py: a minimal assembler and runtime environment
###################################################

"Mal-py" is a minimal assembler and run-time environment to teach assembly.
It focuses on the principles of Assembly using a Von Neumann Architecture.

A special thanks to `pyca/cryptography`_ for their ideas on travis integration
with pyenv, tox, and osx. Much of the meta build system and testing scaffolding
is based significantly off of theirs.

Further API documentation can be found at `documentation`_
